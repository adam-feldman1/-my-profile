					Hello, my name is Adam and i am a first year student at EMLV school. I have many passion in life like video games, football(especially PSGüü•üü¶), but also a lot of other sports. I'm someone really curious who actually like to discover about everything.

				<h2>Video Games <i class="fa-solid fa-gamepad"></i></h2>
				<p>
					One of my passion since im a little kids is too play video games. During My life since today i had many different consoles : i had for example many <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portail:Nintendo/Consoles" target="_blank_" class="a-purple">nintendo consoles</a> like ds, wii or switch. I also played on <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation" target="_blank_" class="a-purple">playstation consoles</a>, i had the PS3 and also the PSP. The last console i bought was from <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation" target="_blank_" class="a-purple">Xbox</a> with the xbox one. Now i also play on my pc or with my virtual reality headset, this is really impressive that thanks to the highimmersion you don't feel time flying when using it. Overall i can say that my top 3 favorites games i have ever played are : mario kart, wii sports and wii party those are only nintendo games because they are also the one i had the best memories with.

				<h2>Football <i class="fa-solid fa-futbol"></i></h2>
				<p>
					I'm also a huge fan of sports especially when it's about the national team, but im above all a huge fan of Paris-Saint-Germain football club. I share this passion with my father who transmitted it to me. We usually try to go once a year at "the parc des princes" the famous stadium of PSG. I guess i am really lucky cause the 4 times i went to the stadium psg won the game. I really love going to watch games because it's really different than when we are behind the tv, it's for sure more exciting but more stressfull as well. I also watch other sports like handball, rugby(with the world cup), tennis or basketball. I had the opportunity for my birtday thanks to my sister to watch the last nba game in paris Detroit Pistons vs Chicago Bulls(my favorite team).

				<h2>My collections <i class="fa-solid fa-store"></i></h2>
				<p>
					During my entire life since now,i've always loved doing little collection but now that i have grew up i have been doing one of my biggest collection with funko pops : smalls figurines with oversized heads. I now have around 150 figurines but sadly i think i don't have anymore spaces for more of them. Like i said i also have smaller collections right now like pins or shoes(even if take a lot of spaces as well !). My objectives for my coming collection is to start a football shirts collection.
